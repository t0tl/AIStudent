# AIStudent
A curriculum for dipping your toes in Fullstack AI

# Overview
This curriculum is designed to give you a taste of what it's like to be a fullstack AI engineer. It's a mix of theory and hands-on practice, with a focus on building real-world projects. The curriculum is divided into three main sections: AI Fundamentals, Fullstack Development, and AI Projects. Each section builds on the previous one, so it's important to follow the order.

# AI Fundamentals
In this section, you'll learn the foundations of python, statistics, and data wrangling. This is the most essential skillset for a data analyst/data science position.

## Week 1: Introduction to Python


## Week 2: Statistics


## Week 3: Data Wrangling


## Week 4: Intro to Machine Learning


## Week 5: Deep Learning


# Fullstack Development
In this section, we will cover the basics of web development, databases, and big data management. This will give you a solid foundation to build AI projects that interact with the web and with terabyte+ scale data. This section is more geared towards Fullstack AI engineering, ML engineering, and data engineering.
## Week 6: Big data management


## Week 7: Web development


## Week 8: Real life applications
